This is the PlayStation 5 - ['Tom Warren', 'Jun']
Sony is finally revealing what the PlayStation 5 looks like.
After nearly an hour of PS5 game announcements, Sony revealed the hardware design after teasing it for the duration of its PS5 live event today.
Just like the Xbox Series X, the PS5 can be placed vertically or horizontally underneath a TV or monitor.
The PS5 will also support an “overwhelming majority” of the more than 4,000 PlayStation 4 titles that exist today.
And Ubisoft has already said that Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is headed to the PlayStation 5 this holiday season.


Spider-Man: Miles Morales is coming to the PS5 this year - ['Chaim Gartenberg', 'Jun']
Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the sequel to 2018’s PS4-exclusive Spider-Man, is officially heading to the PS5, Sony announced today at its PlayStation 5 gameplay event.
A teaser trailer showed off a first look at the upcoming sequel.
Miles Morales appeared in developer Insomniac Games’ Spider-Man as a playable character, but it wasn’t until the end of the game when the character — best known for donning the mantle of Spider-Man in Marvel’s Ultimate universe comics and the animated Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse film — was bit by a radioactive spider, setting up the newly announced sequel.
While Sony’s announcement didn’t show off too much of the gameplay for Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the teaser trailer does show off new abilities, like Miles’ electric venom blasts and stealth camouflaging, along with new features, like changing weather and daylight cycles, that didn’t appear in the original game.
Spider-Man: Miles Morales will launch on the PlayStation 5 holiday 2020.

PS5 Digital Edition will be the first PlayStation to launch without a disc drive - ['Chris Plante', 'Jeffrey Parkin', 'Dave Tach', 'Jun']
The standard edition is the traditional video game console you’d expect from Sony.
For the first time, Sony will begin a generation with hardware lacking a disc drive.
Without the disc drive, the hardware has a sleeker and more symmetrical design.
The standard edition, on the other hand, has an odd protruding lump to make way for discs.
As games continue to be sold online, GameStop’s emphasis on re-selling used copies of boxed games appears to be in danger.

The impressive-looking Project Athia, teased at the PS5 event, is coming to PC - ['Christopher Livingston']
A teaser for Project Athia—a working title—was shown at Sony's PS5 event today.
In addition to all the questions we have about Project Athia (such as "What's Project Athia?
"), we wondered if it was a PS5 exclusive or if it'd be on PC, too.
Hopefully it'll be followed by some news about what exactly Project Athia is, sometime soon.
At least we don't have to doubt it'll be on PC, so that's something.
